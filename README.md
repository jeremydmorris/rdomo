# RDomo
This package provides access to Domo's public APIs for the purpose of transferring data directly to R and helps perform other admin tasks.

## Installation
To install, please install the devtools package and type the following command.

```r
devtools::install_github(repo='jeremydmorris/rdomo')
```

## Setup and Authentication

In order to connect R to Domo, you will need to have a valid set of credentials. Credentials can be generated by going to Domo's [developer site](https://developer.domo.com){:target="_blank"} and do the following.
* Click the "login" button in the top ribbon (just left of the search box).
	* This will take you to a Domo login screen and will require your username and password.
	* If you are currently logged in, you will not be required to give your username and password.
* Once you have signed in, click "My Account" and "New Client".
* Give your client a name and a description (description optional).
* Click any of the resources you want this set of credentials to be able to access.
* Click "Create".

After clicking Create, the developer site will display your client id and secret.

Your client id and secret are then used to authenticate from R. To create a new connection to Domo, use the following code.

```r
domo <- rdomo::Domo(client_id='your client id',secret='your secret',scope=c('data','user'))
```

This code creates an object called "domo" that stores all your connection information and all functions necessary to interact with Domo's API. For example, if you would like to download a data set from Domo, you can now use the following code. (The data set id can be found in the URL for a data set in Domo's data center or you can use the "ds_list" function to get a list of all your data sets.)

```r
my_dataset <- domo$ds_get('some data set id')
```
